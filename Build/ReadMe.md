## Compiled APKs
In the Build folder, we offer two different APKs. Since we used some paid assets (mainly for 3D models and inverse kinematics), we provide an APK with these paid assets and one without. The latter is compiled based on the code and assets available in this Git repository.

* **VRception.apk** is compiled including paid assets and thus, the VRception Toolkit with all functions and options.
* **VRception-Github.apk** is compiled with the source code in this Github repository. This version has the paid assets removed; thus, excluding the player character and inverse kinematics.

Please be aware that for both APKs a multiplayer room is configured, meaning if others use the same APK at the same time, you will likely spawn in one multiplayer room with them (to configure a different room the APK needs to be recompiled).
